Ed Conroy's Peer Review

g_cmds.c:
Line 980:  Change to a switch for more readability

g_local.h:
Line 195:  I like the use of the Binary flags but you probably didn't need them considering anyone playing this game will be using computers
with processing power well beyond the target specs this game was ment for in 1998.

p_client.c:
Line 545:  Switch statement could have been used here to accomplish same thing.  Makes the code look a little neater.


General Comments:

Positive:
-I like the use of bitwise and-ing your flags.  Keeping them constants and at powers of two is a good idea.
-Skill trees are implemented well.
-Code is easy to read and understand.
-Is consistent with Quake naming conventions making it very easy to decipher what is going on.

Negative:
-Has huge if-else blocks which can become hard to read after a while.  Should make them switch statements instead.
